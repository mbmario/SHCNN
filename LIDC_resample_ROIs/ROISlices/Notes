bmp has to have pixeltype of 
	unsigned char -or-
	RGB<unsigned char>

Ziyue wants the 3 planes saved as RGB channels

So procedure needs to be

EXTRACTIMAGEFILTER
-specify target region, then the filter will remove pixels outside that region
	-this is ExtractRegion?

-to collapse dimensions, first specify ExtractRegion
	NEED ExtractionRegion.Size[dim] = 0
	NEED ExtractionRegion.Index[dim] 

-example: reduce a 4x4x4x4 to a 4x4x4
	ExtractionRegion.Size = [4,4,4,0]
	ExtractionRegion.Index = [0,0,0,2] (3rd time slice)


COMIBINING IMAGES
imagemagick can do it in 1 line
opencv can do it too
maybe in itk
