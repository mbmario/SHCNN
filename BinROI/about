PROGRAM

Modify a Python program to read the xml and write the coordinates to a csv (don't worry about conversion)


Parent Python Program:
	-designate x= /xml/, an= /nonbinROI/, seg = /segcsvs/patient, broi = /binary-rois/
		-can use regular analyze but would take longer!
	-find appropriate xfile, anfile, and create segfile
	-for each xml r:
		-child python: gives xmlfile, segfile name → writes segfile 
		-for each nodule-specific file produced by child and associated an
			ITKprogram: given segfile, an, broi name, writes broi 

Child Python:
	-given an xml, writes all coordinates to a csv: x,y,z \n 

 Write an ITK program
	a
		-function: takes a csv of coordinates and reads them into a set/hashtable
		-function: takes image spacing and image space voxel, converts into xml-format coordinate space
	
	b
		-fn: get the set
		-read the image
		-build a non-const ImageLinearIteratorWithIndex
			for each voxel in the iterator		
				fn: convert to the GetIndex index to xml-format coordinate space
				if fn result is in set: change pixel value to 1
				otherwise: change to 0
		-hook image up to writer and write to file
