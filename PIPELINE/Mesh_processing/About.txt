The programs in this directory can take care of everything from raw LIDC through the Spherical Harmonics coefficient computation. 

The only thing that needs to be edited is the directories, and a smoothing parameter that is in 2process_meshes.sh. 

The programs should be run in order of the numbers in the beginning of the filename.

Cases may fail in 2process_meshes.sh (skips bad cases), 4main/off2Gu (skips bad cases) and 4main.sh (must be terminated individually, but main function still runs).
